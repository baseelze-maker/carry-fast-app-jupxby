# Wasel - Travel & Delivery Connection App

## The Core Idea

**Wasel** connects two types of users:

1. **Travelers** - People who are traveling and have extra luggage space
2. **Senders** - People who need to send small items (documents, packages) to another location

Instead of using expensive courier services, senders can connect with travelers going to their destination. Travelers can earn money by utilizing their unused luggage capacity.
