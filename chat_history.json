First, people who are traveling \"travelers\". Second, people who want to deliver/send small items such, including but not limited to, papers, documents, small items. The idea is to enable people who are traveling to benifit from the extra unused waight they have when they are traveling, during a trip. For expamle, if am traveling, I might have extra one KG, which can be used to deliver documents for other users. On the other hand, the other user or \"senders\" insead of resorting to usual cariour services who sometimes take time to deliver these papers, not to mention the expensive charge. The sender will need to be connected with someone who is traveling to the same destination the papers/documents need to be deliverd too. This is the purpose in general. 2. Target Audience: users will be as elaborated above, the \"travelers\" and \"senders\". 3. Core Features: 1- connecting travelers and senders with each other on demand. 2- Let the traveler feature that he will be traveling to a country, and a final destination on specific date and time. 3- let the senders to be able to make searches for the travelers on the basis of thier destinations. (other functionalities can be developed further). 4. Platform: we can start with Android as I know is more flexible. However, in the end the applicaiton needs to exist on both IOS and Android. 5. 6. Timeline: I have no specific timeline to launch the app. 7. Technichal Skills: I have no technichal skills. 8. Design: no design elements ready. 9. Monetization: this needs to be explored.\r\n\r\nnow, based on the above understanding, you are required to create wireframes showcasing each of the pages in the app, based on which we will start creating each page.
